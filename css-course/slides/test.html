Why designers should learn to code and why developers should learn to design.

Designers and developers currently sit on the opposite sides of the internet disco, looking over at each other from different gym benches when we should be mixing and getting on.

A lot of developers suggest that designers should learn how to code. This is something that I believe as well. It makes a designer understand more about the process of how to build which in turn informs how they design.

Knowing your medium is a big part of design. An architect will know what is and isn't possible when they design buildings, a print designer will know about paper quality, types and weights, therefore it should hold true that a web designer should know about HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Of course, there's a difference between knowing how they work and really knowing how they interact. If you've never built a basic site from scratch, it may mean that you're not fully knowing how everything works together.

Craft

I've worked in many different parts of the web industry – from creative agencies and startups to being freelance and co-founding companies – and I've found that there's a very strong correlation between the best web designers and web designers who know code (and the opposite holds true too, the not-so-great designers generally don't know how to code).

I don't think that learning to code will suddenly mean that you're a better designer. I do think that it comes down to believing in your craft. The best designers want to be craftspeople. They truly care about what they're creating so they want to learn as much as possible about the process.

It's also a willingness to admit that you don't know things. It's fine if you don't know particular things (https://sivers.org/ss), in fact it's particularly powerful to accept it and want to learn. There's a few "old school" designers I know who refuse to learn anything because they're set in their ways or too stubborn to try something new. It's their decision but over the next 10 years, they'll start to get left behind by a generation of designers who code.

Alongside this generation of designers getting left behind will be a generation of developers getting left behind too.

Hey there developer

Developers: you're not getting away with being complacent. Design is a big part of development. If you're making products for people to use, you have to care about how things look and work. Your job isn't just to write code, it's to make products and services for people to use and part of that process is to have good design. The more you contribute to and care about the design process, the better your end product will be.

Look at any of the best web apps and you'll see one recurring – good design. This doesn't just happen by having a separate design team and a separate development team. It happens by having both teams that care about each others work and by having an overlap between teams.

Craftsmanship for developers means two things in my opinion. The first is quality of code - writing beautiful, understandable code that is easily comprehendible but powerful is tricky and take years of practice and dedication. The second is caring about the look and feel of the products you're putting out in the world. It's the last 20% of effort that you put into your work that really counts.

As designers and developers, we should be more tolerant of each other. It's very easy to blame other people for faults in the making of web products. If you think your designer is designing things that wouldn't make the site work, you need to tell them. If you think your developer isn't implementing the correct font sizes, you need to tell them. Communication is key.

The easiest way to overcome these problems long term is to learn more about each other's process.

I'm not saying that designers should learn to be developers and developers should learn to be designers, but having an appreciation of what other people do is beyond valuable.
